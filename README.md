# Combo-Skincare

For people that have too many skin products and aren’t quite sure about the order that they should use them in. Can make a profile, add a profile pic, and upload products, the site takes in a user’s products and puts them in the order that they should be using them.

## Installation

Run npm i in your terminal to install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

## Usage

![profile page](./public/photos/porefecthome.jpg)

Logging in gives you the ability to go to the profile page, which is where most of the app's functionality exists. You can add a picture to your profile, and add various skincare products to your page, which get auto populated in the order they should be used in.
